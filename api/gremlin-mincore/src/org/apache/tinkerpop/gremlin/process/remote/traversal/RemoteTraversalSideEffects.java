/**
 * When a traversal is executed remotely, the ability to retrieve those side-effects (i.e. the value in "a" in the
 * traversal {@code g.V().aggregate('a').values('name')}) can be exposed through this interface. As an example,
 * with TinkerPop's {@code DriverRemoteConnection} that connects to Gremlin Server as a "remote", the side-effects
 * are left on the server. The {@code RemoteTraversalSideEffects} implementation, in that case, lazily loads those
 * side-effects when requested. Implementations should attempt to match the features of the locally processed
 * {@link DefaultTraversalSideEffects} to keep consistency.
