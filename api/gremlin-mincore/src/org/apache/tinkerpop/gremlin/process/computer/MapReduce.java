/**
 * A MapReduce is composed of map(), combine(), and reduce() stages.
 * The map() stage processes the vertices of the {@link org.apache.tinkerpop.gremlin.structure.Graph} in a logically parallel manner.
 * The combine() stage aggregates the values of a particular map emitted key prior to sending across the cluster.
 * The reduce() stage aggregates the values of the combine/map emitted keys for the keys that hash to the current machine in the cluster.
 * The interface presented here is nearly identical to the interface popularized by Hadoop save the map() is over the vertices of the graph.
