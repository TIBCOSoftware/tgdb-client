/**
 * A generalized custom serializer registry for providers implementing a {@link Graph}.  Providers should develop an
 * implementation of this interface if their implementation requires custom serialization of identifiers or other
 * such content housed in their graph.  Consider extending from {@link AbstractIoRegistry} and ensure that the
 * implementation has a zero-arg constructor or a static "instance" method that returns an {@code IoRegistry}
 * instance, as implementations may need to be constructed from reflection given different parts of the TinkerPop
 * stack.
 * <p/>
 * The serializers to register depend on the {@link Io} implementations that are expected to be supported.  There
 * are currently two core implementations in {@link GryoIo} and {@link GraphSONIo}.  Both of these should be supported
 * for full compliance with the test suite.
 * <p/>
 * There is no need to use this class if the {@link Graph} does not have custom classes that require serialization.
