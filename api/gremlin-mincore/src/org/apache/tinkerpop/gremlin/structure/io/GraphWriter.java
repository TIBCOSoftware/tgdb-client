/**
 * Functions for writing a graph and its elements to a serialized format. Implementations of this class do not need
 * to explicitly guarantee that an object written with one method must have its format equivalent to another. In other
 * words, calling {@link #writeVertex(OutputStream, Vertex)}} need not have equivalent output to
 * {@link #writeObject(OutputStream, Object)}.  Nor does the representation of an {@link Edge} within the output of
 * {@link #writeVertex(OutputStream, Vertex, Direction)} need to match the representation of that same
 * {@link Edge} when provided to {@link #writeEdge(OutputStream, Edge)}. In other words, implementations are free
 * to optimize as is possible for a specific serialization method.
 * <p/>
 * That said, it is however important that the complementary "read" operation in {@link GraphReader} be capable of
 * reading the output of the writer.  In other words, the output of {@link #writeObject(OutputStream, Object)}
 * should always be readable by {@link GraphReader#readObject(InputStream, Class)} and the output of
 * {@link #writeGraph(OutputStream, Graph)} should always be readable by
 * {@link GraphReader#readGraph(InputStream, Graph)}.
