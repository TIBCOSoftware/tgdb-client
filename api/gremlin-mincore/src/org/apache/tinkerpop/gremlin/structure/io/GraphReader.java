/**
 * Functions for reading a graph and its graph elements from a different serialization format. Implementations of
 * this class do not need to explicitly guarantee that an object read with one method must have its format
 * equivalent to another. In other words the input to {@link #readVertex(InputStream, Function)}} need not also
 * be readable by {@link #readObject(InputStream, Class)}. In other words, implementations are free
 * to optimize as is possible for a specific serialization method.
 * <p/>
 * That said, it is however important that the complementary "write" operation in {@link GraphWriter} be capable of
 * writing output compatible to its reader.  In other words, the output of
 * {@link GraphWriter#writeObject(OutputStream, Object)} should always be readable by
 * {@link #readObject(InputStream, Class)} and the output of {@link GraphWriter#writeGraph(OutputStream, Graph)}
 * should always be readable by {@link #readGraph(InputStream, Graph)}.
