/**
 * A set of methods that allow for control of transactional behavior of a {@link Graph} instance. Providers may
 * consider using {@link AbstractTransaction} as a base implementation that provides default features for most of
 * these methods.
 * <p/>
 * It is expected that this interface be implemented by providers in a {@link ThreadLocal} fashion. In other words
 * transactions are bound to the current thread, which means that any graph operation executed by the thread occurs
 * in the context of that transaction and that there may only be one thread executing in a single transaction.
 * <p/>
 * It is important to realize that this class is not a "transaction object".  It is a class that holds transaction
 * related methods thus hiding them from the {@link Graph} interface.  This object is not meant to be passed around
 * as a transactional context.
